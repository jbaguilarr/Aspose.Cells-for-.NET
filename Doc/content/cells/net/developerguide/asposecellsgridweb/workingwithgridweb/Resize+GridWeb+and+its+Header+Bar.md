## Changing Width & Height of Aspose.Cells.GridWeb

Changing the width and height of Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control is a simple but important feature. The Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control is represented by the `GridWeb` class in the API. To resize the width and height of the GridWeb control, simply use its width and height properties.

The width and height of the control can be defined in pixels or points.

The output of the code snippet that follows is shown below.
