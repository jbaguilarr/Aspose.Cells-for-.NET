Aspose.Cells for .NET : Copy a Worksheet  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Copy a Worksheet


[Add Worksheets](http://localhost:1313/cellsnet/developerguide/asposecellsgridweb/workingwithgridwebworksheets/add+worksheets) describes how to add new worksheets to Aspose.Cells.GridWeb. It's also possible to add a copy (or replica) of another worksheet to the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control. This feature can be useful when identical or similar data in one worksheet is also required in another worksheet. When that's the case, it's easier to copy an existing worksheet and add it to Aspose.Cells.GridWeb as a new worksheet instead of creating it from scratch.
