# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Load Workbook with specified Printer Paper Size


You can specify the printer paper size of your choice while loading your workbook using the [LoadOptions.SetPaperSize()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/loadoptions/methods/setpapersize) method. Please note, if you create a new file in MS Excel, you will find the paper size is the same as the setting of the default printer in your machine.
