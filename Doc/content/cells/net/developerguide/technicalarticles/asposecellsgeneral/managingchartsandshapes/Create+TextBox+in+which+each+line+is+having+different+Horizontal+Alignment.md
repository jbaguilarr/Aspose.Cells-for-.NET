# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Create TextBox in which each line is having different Horizontal Alignment


You can set the horizontal alignment of your paragraph text using the [TextParagraph.AlignmentType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/textparagraph/properties/alignmenttype) property.
