# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Setting ScaleCrop and LinksUpToDate properties of Built-In Document Properties


## Possible Usage Scenarios

[ScaleCrop](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/properties/scalecrop) and [LinksUpToDate](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/properties/linksuptodate) are two extended built-in document properties defined inside the OpenXml format. The purpose of these properties are following

## 1) ScaleCrop

This element indicates the display mode of the document thumbnail. Set this element to **TRUE** to enable scaling of the document thumbnail to the display. Set this element to **FALSE** to enable cropping of the document thumbnail to show only sections that fit the display.

The possible values for this element are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype.

## 2) LinksUpToDate

This element indicates whether hyperlinks in a document are up-to-date. Set this element to **TRUE** to indicate that hyperlinks are updated. Set this element to **FALSE** to indicate that hyperlinks are outdated.

The possible values for this element are defined by the W3C XML Schema boolean datatype.
