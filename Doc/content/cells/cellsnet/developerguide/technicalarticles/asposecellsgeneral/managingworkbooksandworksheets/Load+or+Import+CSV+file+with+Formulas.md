# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Load or Import CSV file with Formulas


CSV file mostly contains textual data and they do not contain any formulas. However, sometimes it happens that CSV files also contain formulas. Such CSV files should be loaded by setting the [TxtLoadOptions.HasFormula](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/txtloadoptions/properties/hasformula) as **true**. Once this property will be set **true**, Aspose.Cells will not treat formula as simple text. They will be treated as formula and Aspose.Cells formula calculation engine will process them as usual.
