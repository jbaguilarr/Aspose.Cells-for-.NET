## Possible Usage Scenarios

When there are multiple shapes present in the same location then how will they be visible is decided by their z-order positions. Aspose.Cells provides [Shape.ToFrontOrBack()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/tofrontorback)Â method which changes the z-order position of the shape. If you want to send shape to back you will use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. and if you want to send shape to the front, you will use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.
