# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check if Digital Signature of VBA Code is Valid


Aspose.Cells allows you to check if the digital signature of the VBA code is valid using the [Workbook.VbaProject.IsValidSigned](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/properties/isvalidsigned) property. It will return **true** if the signature is valid otherwise it will return **false**. The digital signature of the VBA code becomes invalid when you change the VBA code.
